# Backends: mapping your systems

`StorefrontBackend` and `MerchantBackend` translate your systems into the records the
agents read. This guide covers identity and credentials, ordered flows, checkout, products
with options, and missing figures. The method docstrings in each role's `backend.py` and
`types.py` are the contract. The retail and telecom examples show all of it running.

## Step 1: Decide who the caller is and how you authenticate

**Bind identity at session start.** Your host authenticates the caller and starts a session
with the principal it resolved: a customer id for the shopping agent, a merchant id and an
operator for the merchant agent. Every backend method receives that session object and
reads the identity from it. No route and no tool argument ever carries a user id.

**Keep the credential beside the identity.** Whatever your backend needs to call your
platform for that principal lives with the session, never with the model:

- A per-customer token: put it on a subclass of the session context, or in a store your host
  fills at sign-in and the backend reads by customer id.
- A service credential: pass it to the backend's constructor.

**Treat a guest as a principal.** Mark the session as a guest. When a read needs an account
(order history, saved addresses), raise an exception your executor subclass turns into "ask
the customer to sign in". When the guest signs in, start a new session. The example hosts
take a demo profile id at session start as a stand-in for real sign-in.

**On Managed Agents,** the platform holds one credential per MCP server in a vault, and your
MCP server derives the customer from the authenticated request. Carry a per-customer
identity as one vault credential per customer session, or as a signed claim your gateway
verifies on each request.

## Step 2: Keep multi-step flows in order

Some flows only make sense in sequence: verify identity, then check eligibility, then
submit; hold seats, then confirm. The backend enforces that order.

1. Keep the flow's state in the backend, keyed by session.
2. When a call arrives before the step it depends on, raise your own exception class.
3. Map that class in an executor subclass (`domain_error`) so the tool result names the
   missing step instead of reading as a system failure. The model then tells the customer
   what comes first.
4. For a write your platform deduplicates, derive an idempotency key from the session id
   and a hash of the cart lines.
5. When the customer completes a step outside the conversation (a payment page, a
   verification code), have the host queue an app event on the session; the next turn reads
   it.

The entertainment example's ticketing engine enforces hold limits, expiry, and ownership
this way, and its executor subclass relays the engine's messages to the model.

## Step 3: Decide how checkout completes

The `checkout` tool ends the agent's part: it renders the cart. Nothing in this repo places
an order or takes payment. Pick one of three handoffs for the checkout card:

| Your situation | What the card does | What you implement |
|---|---|---|
| Checkout is a route in your own app | Links to that route | Nothing; the default applies |
| Platform hosted checkout (the cart API cannot take payment server-side) | Opens the platform's hosted checkout URL | `checkout_handoff` returns the URL for this cart |
| Marketplace where each seller checks out separately | Shows one link per seller | `checkout_handoff` returns one entry per seller |

The executor adds what `checkout_handoff` returns to the card's payload after the model's
call, so the URL never passes through the model. The example cards link only `https` URLs. When payment completes, queue an app event
so the next turn knows.

## Step 4: Map products with options

A product or listing record is one of three shapes:

| Shape | How to recognize it | What the agents do with it |
|---|---|---|
| Plain | No options | Search returns it; the cart, price updates, and restocks take its id |
| Family | Has `options`, e.g. size: twin, queen, king | Search returns it; details list its variants. Cart, price, and restock writes need a variant id; pause, promotion, and content edits may name the family |
| Variant | Has `option_values` (one value per option) and `variant_of` (the family's id) | Returned inside its family's details with its own id, price, and stock; the cart, price updates, and restocks take its id |

A variant's id goes wherever a product or listing id goes; there is no separate variant-id
field. Family and variant ids share one namespace, so if a parent's platform id can equal a
child's, prefix the family id in your backend. Search matches option values as well as
attributes, so a filter like size = king works. A backend that has already resolved every
option from the query may return the variant from search; otherwise search returns
families.

**Mapping from common catalog models.**

| Your catalog | Family | Variant | Plain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parent and child records; the parent is not purchasable | The parent: its id, content, and variation attributes as options | Each child: id, price, stock, option values, parent id | A standalone product |
| Every row is a purchasable SKU; siblings share a group key (a shopping feed) | Synthesized: a prefixed group key as the id, the first row's title and image, options collected from the rows; details resolve that id | Each row, with the synthesized id as its family | A row with no group |
| A product shell that always has variants; price and stock only on variants | The product: id, content, option names and values | Each variant | A one-variant product, served under the variant's id with no options |

```text
your platform                              this record
product  P-88  "Trail Tee"                 {"product_id": "P-88", "title": "Trail Tee", "price": 24.0,
  option  size: S M L                       "options": {"size": ["S", "M", "L"]}}
  variant V-1  S  24.00  12 in stock       details.variants[0] = {"product_id": "V-1", "price": 24.0,
  variant V-2  M  24.00   0 in stock         "in_stock": true, "option_values": {"size": "S"},
  variant V-3  L  26.00   4 in stock         "variant_of": "P-88"}  … and V-2, V-3
```

**What is not a variant.**

- A price or availability computed per request (a nightly rate for searched dates, a fare
  for a party size, a seat). The request's dimensions arrive as search filters and the
  record returned is a quote for that context. The travel example prices stays this way. A
  booking engine whose room types are stocked and priced apart may still list them as
  variants of a property.
- Siblings that differ in more than their option values (ticket tiers with their own
  sections and fees; plan tiers with their own allowances). Keep them as separate records
  grouped by an attribute, as the entertainment example does.
- One product sold by several sellers at different prices. A record has one price: return
  the offer you would sell, or list each offer as its own record.
- Built-to-order products, bundles, and menu items with modifiers. The choices travel as
  request attributes or in your own cart extension, and the backend prices them.
- Goods priced by measured weight. Quantity counts whole units, so sell them as fixed packs,
  which may themselves be variants.

**A family's own figures.**

- Storefront price is the lowest in-stock variant's (a "from" price); a family is in stock
  while any variant is.
- Portal price is the lowest variant's, in stock or not, so the catalog does not show a move
  when a size sells out; stock is the sum. The portal reads the per-variant range from the
  pricing context.
- Title, description, and image describe the family. A variant may override any field it
  inherits (a color with its own image). Inside the family's details each variant is a
  compact row: id, option values, price, stock, and only the fields that differ.
- Only the variants listed exist. If the king/blush row is absent, the product is not sold in
  king/blush; the agent says so and offers the nearest listed variant.

**How many variants.** Details return every variant of a family inside one fenced result,
capped at `max_fenced_chars` (12,000 characters by default). A compact row is 70 to 120
characters, so a family holds up to about sixty variants. Serve a larger matrix as one
family per leading option: a shoe in eight colors and fourteen sizes becomes eight families
of fourteen. Past the cap the result is cut short with no error, so check your largest
family against it.

**Out of stock.** When `add_to_cart` names a variant that exists but cannot be bought, raise
`Unavailable` with a message of ids only: what is out, and which sibling variants are in
stock. The executor relays it and nothing is written. The retail and telecom examples do
this. Use `NotOffered` and the `enable_*` switches for things the store does not sell at all.

## Step 5: Apply merchant writes to families

| Write | Names | On the family id |
|---|---|---|
| Price update | A variant | Held by the executor, which points at the variant ids; "all sizes up 5%" is one item per variant |
| Restock | A variant | Held the same way |
| Pause or activate | Either | Takes every variant off sale or back on |
| Promotion | Either | Expands to one line per variant, each with its own before and after; each counts toward the items-per-change limit |
| Content edit | Either | Edits shared content; a backend whose variants share the family's content fields refuses those fields on a variant, as the retail example does |

If your domain prices under another field name (a nightly rate, a fare), add it to
`price_bearing_fields` on the merchant config, or the price cap is not checked.

## Step 6: Return `None` for figures your platform cannot supply

Never return a stand-in zero. Return `None` and say why in a short note.

| Where | What to return |
|---|---|
| Business snapshot | `None` for traffic, conversion rate, or average order value it lacks; the note says which |
| Metric series | An empty series with a note saying why |
| Campaign | `None` for spend or revenue the channel does not report |
| Pricing context | `min_price_basis`: whether the floor is the item's cost or a store rule |
| Inventory alerts, order issues | Alerts and issues derived from stock and orders when the platform has no such object; only the kinds you can compute |
| Merchant context | A `limitations` list (source and one clause each) for store-wide gaps, such as a short order history |

The retail merchant example returns two limitations: a 90-day order history and an email
channel that reports no revenue.

## Where to see it in the examples

- Retail catalog: a mattress by size (one size out of stock, prices that step), a pillowcase
  set by size and color (one combination out of stock), a tinted moisturizer in six shades
  at one price, and a weighted blanket whose description states the rule for choosing a
  weight.
- Telecom catalog: a phone by storage and color, with an installment per variant.
- Fixtures author variants compactly under their family; the shared loader fills in the rest
  and derives the options. The wire shape is what the details tool returns.
- Retail and telecom `merchant_inventory.json` hold the matching variant rows; the retail
  merchant context shows `limitations`; the entertainment example shows a fixed-order flow.
