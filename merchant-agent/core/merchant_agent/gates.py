"""The merchant gates and the wording every path returns when one holds. Staged writes
accept only listing and campaign ids that tools returned this session; a price or

discard accept only change ids that staging or ``get_pending_changes`` returned;
apply re-checks the guardrails and, when the deployment requires it, the host's
